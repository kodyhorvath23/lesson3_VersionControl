## Project Description:
This assignment was designed to familiarize us with using Github and cloud9. We had to use basic git commands on cloud 9 and also summarize five key concepts we learned throughout the lesson. 

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:

2. Another thing we learned in this lesson was how to connect github to cloud 9 and perform basic commands through the terminal. These included git init, commit, and push.
3. Finally we learned what exactly git does for a user. It is desgined to handle small and large projects with high speeds and efficiency.
