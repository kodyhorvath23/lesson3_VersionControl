            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems automatically note who changed the files which is also known as revision history. The system also noted when they were changed and what about them is new or different. VCS will then merge changes to the same file. These files cannot be overwritten by other team members. The team you are working with can work on the same file simultaneously without any problems. If forever whatever reason you need to go back to an older version of the file or project this system allows you to. This system uses repositories to control history. I will talk more about this in the next highlight. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Within a VCS there is a term called repository. This has a few jobs. The repository controls history so when one is created with files and directories the developers can record their change history and start tracking their status and versions. There are two types of repositories the first one is called a remote repository. The remote repository resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members. The second is a local repository which resides on a local machine of an individual user. To create a local repository, you can either create a brand new repository or clone an existing remote repository onto your local machine. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. It is designed to handle small and large projects with high speed and efficiency. Being a distributed VCS this means that’s every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine. Since everything is local this allows you to work offline. There is no absolute single point of failure and processes tend to run much faster. Git will prevent an unintentional overwrite of a file on the shared repository. Git uses commands to speak to itself and the repositories. The main ones we use is add, commit, and push. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As previously stated Git uses commands such as add, commit, and push. These commands are used to speak to itself and the repository. GIT ADD is where we add all the files that were changed since the last backup to the staging area. GIT COMMIT is where we commit the changes to the repository. Next comes GIT PUSH and this is where we push the changes in local repository to the remote repository. Some other commands we learned and will use consist of INIT & REMOTE ADD ORIGIN, which are used in the very beginning stages before the previous terms mentioned. GIT INIT initializes the repository and GIT REMOTE ADD ORIGIN __ tells Git to add a remote place called ‘origin’ whose url is whatever you prefer.
